# aiboarding: Onboard AI Agents Like Fresh Engineers

aiboarding treats every AI coding agent as a new hire. It maintains one compressed, high-signal `AIBOARDING.md` per repository — the project's engineering basics, domain logic, and AI-specific gotchas — and guarantees, via committed hooks, that agents read it on entry and keep it current as the code evolves. No more re-explaining the codebase to every fresh session, sub-agent, or post-compaction context.

> **Status — v0.1.2.** The full **create → sync → update** lifecycle is now implemented: the plugin scaffold, the cross-platform `sync` hook templates (with a full test harness), the **`create-aiboarding` skill** (hybrid crawl + grilling generator that writes `AIBOARDING.md` and installs the hooks), and the **`update-aiboarding` skill** — the commit-triggered drift-triage that auto-advances the sync pointer on no-op changes and runs a targeted-delta patch when scope drifts. The hook-injection and skill-reasoning runtime behaviors are not yet verified against the live Claude Code runtime (see [Roadmap](#roadmap)).

## The Idea

A new engineer joining a project gets onboarded: they read the docs, learn the stack, absorb the domain language, and get warned about the landmines. AI agents get none of that — they re-derive context from scratch every session, and they repeat the same mistakes. aiboarding closes that gap with a three-stage lifecycle:

| Stage | Component | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create** | `create-aiboarding` *(shipped v0.1.1)* | Generates `AIBOARDING.md` via a hybrid background code-crawl + relentless grilling interrogation, caveman-compresses it, then installs the hooks. |
| **Sync** | `sync-aiboarding` *(hooks — shipped v0.1.0)* | Injects the document into every agent's context — at session start, after compaction, and into spawned sub-agents. |
| **Update** | `update-aiboarding` *(shipped v0.1.2)* | On every commit, triages the diff against the doc's scope and patches only the sections that drifted (auto-advances the pointer on no-op changes). |

---

## How Sync Works (shipped in v0.1.0)

Skills cannot guarantee their own invocation — only **hooks** can. aiboarding's enforcement layer is therefore a set of committed, deterministic hook scripts, not model-invoked skills.

| Event | Hook | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SessionStart` (`startup\|clear\|compact`) | `session-start` | Emits `AIBOARDING.md` as session context. Missing doc → prompts `create-aiboarding`. |
| `PreToolUse` (`Task`) | `pre-task` | Prepends the doc to spawned sub-agents (no native sub-agent-spawn hook exists). |
| `PostToolUse` (`Bash`) | `post-commit` | Compares frontmatter `last_synced_commit` to git `HEAD`; nudges `update-aiboarding` on drift. |

All three run through a single **polyglot `run-hook.cmd`** — one file valid as both Windows CMD and bash. On Windows it locates Git Bash and dispatches; on macOS/Linux bash treats the CMD block as a no-op heredoc and runs the script directly. If no bash is found on Windows, injection degrades silently rather than erroring. The pattern is adapted from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).

## The `AIBOARDING.md` Document

Drift state lives in YAML frontmatter; the body is three caveman-compressed sections.

```markdown
---
aiboarding_version: 1
generated: 2026-05-29
last_synced_commit: <sha>
---
# 1. Engineering Basics     — stack, build, test, run commands
# 2. Domain & Business Logic — what it does, why, core concepts
# 3. AI-Specific Context     — gotchas, known failure modes, guardrails
```

`last_synced_commit` is the single drift signal: `update-aiboarding` diffs `<last_synced_commit>..HEAD` to decide whether the document needs a patch.

---

## Quick Start

```text
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add gustavo-meilus/aiboarding
/plugin install aiboarding@aiboarding
```

Then generate the doc and wire up enforcement in one pass:

```text
/create-aiboarding      # interview + crawl → writes AIBOARDING.md, installs the hooks
# ...from then on, every session, sub-agent, and post-compaction context is auto-onboarded
/update-aiboarding      # triage drift after commits → targeted-delta patch (or silent pointer advance)
```

> As the code evolves, the `post-commit` hook nudges you when `AIBOARDING.md` may have drifted;
> running `/update-aiboarding` triages the diff and patches only the affected sections — or
> silently advances the sync pointer when nothing in scope changed.

Run the test suite for the shipped hook templates (requires Git Bash on Windows):

```bash
bash tests/run.sh
```

## Roadmap

The create → sync → update lifecycle is now feature-complete. Remaining work is hardening and distribution — the manual procedures live in the [verification runbook](./docs/VERIFICATION.md):

- **Distribution** — the marketplace listing (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) is published so `/plugin install aiboarding@aiboarding` resolves; confirm via the runbook's 2a protocol.
- **Hardening** — live verification that `PreToolUse` `additionalContext` reaches sub-agents (else switch to `updatedInput`, per the runbook's 1a decision tree); exercise `update-aiboarding`'s reasoning branches against a live runtime (runbook 1e); narrow the `PostToolUse` matcher to `git commit` commands.
